<h3>NAPOLEON A POET.</h3>

  <p>In a work entitled <i>Littérature Française Contemporaine</i>, vol.
  ii. p. 268., there is a notice of the Bonaparte family, in their
  connexion with literature, in which it is stated that Napoleon, at the
  age of thirteen, wrote the following fable:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Le Chien, le Lapin, et le Chasseur.</i></p>
      <p class="i2">César, chien d'arrêt renommé,</p>
      <p class="i2">Mais trop enflé de son mérite,</p>
      <p class="i2">Tenait arrêté dans son gîte</p>
      <p>Un malheureux lapin de peur inanimé.</p>
      <p>&mdash;Rends-toi, lui cria-t-il, d'une voix de tonnerre,</p>
      <p>Qui fit au loin trembler les peuplades des bois:</p>
      <p class="i2">Je suis César, connu par ses exploits,</p>
      <p class="i2">Et dont le nom remplit toute la terre.</p>
      <p class="i2">A ce grand nom, Jeannot lapin,</p>
      <p>Recommandant à Dieu son âme pénitente,</p>
      <p class="i2">Demande, d'une voix tremblante:</p>
      <p class="i2">&mdash;Très sérénissime mâtin,</p>
      <p class="i2">Si je me rends, quel sera mon destin?</p>
      <p class="i2">&mdash;Tu mourras.&mdash;Je mourrai! dit la bête innocente.</p>
      <p class="i2">Et si je fuis?&mdash;Ton trépas est certain.</p>
      <p>&mdash;Quoi? dit l'animal qui se nourrit de thym;</p>
      <p class="i2">Des deux côtés je dois perdre la vie!</p>
      <p class="i2">Que votre auguste seigneurie</p>
      <p>Veuille me pardonner, puisqu'il faut mourir,</p>
      <p class="i3">Si j'ose tenter de m'enfuir.</p>
      <p>Il dit, et fuit en héros de garenne.</p>
      <p>Caton l'aurait blâmé: je dis qu'il n'eut pas tort:</p>
      <p class="i2">Car le chasseur le voit à peine,</p>
      <p>Qu'il l'ajuste, le tire&mdash;et le chien tombe mort.</p>
      <p>Que dirait de ceci notre bon La Fontaine?</p>
      <p class="i2">Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera:</p>
      <p class="i2">J'approuve fort cette méthode-là."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The writer of the notice (M. Quérard) says this "fable" was composed
  by Napoleon in 1782; and he thus explains the circumstances under which
  he obtained a knowledge of it:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Cette fable a été imprimée dans un ouvrage dont nous ne pouvons
  donner le titre, parce que nous n'avons que le seul feuillet qui la
  contient. Nous ne savons aux soin de quel éditeur on doit de nous l'avoir
  fait connaître. Nous lisons au recto du feuillet en question, que, 'sans
  lui (l'éditeur), cette fable serait encore <!-- Page 302 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page302"></a>{302}</span>perdue peut-être parmi
  les accidens ignorés de cette contrée rocailleuse (de la Corse).' Cet
  apologue n'étant que peu ou point connu, nous croyons faire plaisir en le
  reproduisant."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>My own conviction is, that the greatest "fable" of all is the
  ascription to Napoleon, at the age of thirteen, of a poem which would do
  no discredit to an older and more practised hand. In his maturer years he
  wrote the <i>Mémoire sur la Culture du Mûrier</i>, the <i>Lettre à M.
  Matteo Buttafuoco</i>, the <i>Souper de Beaucaire</i>, and the
  <i>Discours</i> upon a subject proposed by Abbé Regnal to the Academy of
  Lyons; and these productions are confessedly "au-dessous du médiocre."
  With what show of reason, then, can we accept him as the author of a
  poetical effusion which, considering the age at which it is alleged to
  have been written, would throw into the shade the vaunted precocity of
  such professed poets as Cowley, Pope, Chatterton, and Louis Racine?</p>

  <p>But whatever may be the origin of this fable, the assigning of it to
  Napoleon is in itself a singular circumstance. The dog César, who holds
  the rabbit a prisoner in his "gîte," and who summons him to surrender;
  and the unfortunate rabbit who prefers making his escape, "en héros de
  garenne," are so obviously applicable to the personal history of
  Napoleon, that it is impossible to conceive how the French (except on the
  score of their infatuation in everything that relates to that great man)
  could represent him as the author of such a satire upon himself.</p>

<h3>ST. COLUMBA'S CROSS.</h3>

  <p>In 1584 Sir John Perrot, lord-deputy of Ireland, writes to Sir Francis
  Walsingham, the secretary of state:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For a token I have sent you holie Columkill's crosse, a god of great
  veneration with Surleboy <!-- Page 303 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page303"></a>{303}</span>(M&lsquo;Donnell) and all Ulster; for so
  great was his grace, as happy he thought himself that could gett a kisse
  of the said crosse. I send him unto you, that when you have made some
  sacrifice to him, according to the disposition you beare to idolatrie,
  you maie if you please bestowe him upon my good Lady Walsingham, or my
  Lady Sidney, to weare as a jewell of weight and bignesse, and not of
  price and goodness, upon some solempne feaste or triumphe daie at the
  Courte."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Walsingham's daughter was married to the celebrated Sir Philip Sidney;
  and afterwards to Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex; and, thirdly, to
  Richard De Burgh, Earl of Clanricard, when she embraced the Roman
  Catholic religion, that of her last husband, and may perhaps have
  regarded St. Columba's cross with more veneration than did the rugged old
  Perrot.</p>

  <p>It may be possible to trace out this ancient relique to its present
  repository, if it be still in existence.</p>

  <p><i>Drawing an Inference.</i>&mdash;The following is an amusing
  instance of false inference, drawn through ignorance of the original.
  William Rae Wilson is the innocent offender, in his <i>Travels in Egypt
  and the Holy Land</i> (London, Longmans, 1824, 2nd edition). The author
  remarks (p. 105.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This I am inclined to believe was not the track which was taken by
  the Apostle Paul, when he went up to Jerusalem from the coast, as he
  appears to have travelled in some <i>conveyance moved on wheels</i>; for
  it is so far from being in any degree possible to draw one along, that,
  on the contrary, a great exertion is necessary for travellers to get
  forward their mules."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On referring to his authority for such an unapostolic mode of
  locomotion, we find (Acts xxi. 15.) these words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And after those days we took up our <i>carriages</i>, and went up to
  Jerusalem."</p>

  <p>"<span title="Meta de tas hêmeras tautas aposkeuasamenoi anebainomen eis Hierousalêm." class="grk"

</blockquote>

  <p>The word "carriages" conveyed to the mind of our traveller the idea of
  a "conveyance moved on wheels;" whereas our translators intended the term
  to signify <i>anything carried</i>. Professor Scholefield, in his
  <i>Hints for an improved Translation of the New Testament</i>, renders
  the passage, "We put up our baggage." In fact, <i>carriage</i>,
  <i>luggage</i>, and <i>baggage</i> may be termed synonymes; for carriage
  = that which <i>is</i> carried; luggage = that which <i>is</i> lugged;
  and baggage = that which <i>is</i> bagged. The word "carriage" is used in
  this sense, Judges xviii. 21., and again 1 Sam. xvii. 22.</p>

  <p>"<i>Edmund Spenser.</i>&mdash;The literary world will be glad to learn
  that the locality of the illustrious author of <i>The Faëry Queen</i> has

  fortunate in identifying it with that of the great Elizabethan bard, and,
  we are informed, is about to lay the particulars before the public. The
  little rural village of Hurstwood, near Burnley, in Lancashire, is the
  honoured locality; and in the romantic Alpine scenery of that
  neighbourhood it is probable Spenser took refuge when he was driven by
  academical disappointments 'to his relations in the north of England.'
  The family of that great poet appear to have resided at Hurstwood about
  four hundred years, that is, from the early part of the reign of Edward
  II. to the year 1690."&mdash;<i>The Times</i>, Wednesday, June 16,

  of these unfortunates, is given in the <i>Weekly Journal</i> of Saturday,
  July 20, 1723:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On Tuesday last some thousands of the Minters went out of the Land of
  Bondage, <i>alias</i> The Mint, to be cleared at the Quarter Sessions at
  Guildford, according to the late Act of Parliament. The road was covered
  with them, insomuch that they looked like one of the Jewish tribes going
  out of Egypt: the cavalcade consisting of caravans, carts, and waggons,
  besides numbers on horses, asses, and on foot. The drawer of the two
  fighting-cocks was seen to lead an ass loaded with geneva, to support the
  spirits of the ladies upon the journey. 'Tis said, that several heathen
  Bailiffs lay in ambuscade in ditches upon the road, to surprise some of
  them, if possible, on their march, if they should straggle from the main
  body; but they proceeded with so much order and discipline, that they did
  not lose a man upon this expedition."</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>THE SPECTRE HORSEMEN OF SOUTHERFELL.</h3>

  <p>On this mountain, which I believe is in the barony of Greystoke,
  Cumberland, a remarkable phenomenon is said to have been witnessed more
  than a century ago, circumstances of which appear to have been
  these:&mdash;In 1743 one Daniel Stricket, then servant to John Wren, of
  Wilton Hill, a shepherd, was sitting one evening after supper (the month
  is not mentioned) at the door with his master, when they saw a man with a
  dog pursuing some horses on Southerfell-side, a place so steep that a
  horse can scarcely travel on it at all; and they seemed to run at an
  amazing pace, and to disappear at the low end of the fell. Master and man
  resolved to go next morning to the steep side of the mountain, on which
  they expected to find that the horses had lost their shoes from the rate
  at which they galloped, and the man his life. They went, but to their
  surprise they found no vestige of horses having passed that way. They
  said nothing about their vision for some time, fearing the ridicule of
  their neighbours, and this they did not fail to receive when they at
  length ventured to relate their story. On the 23rd June (the eve of St.
  John's Day) in the following year (1744), Stricket, who was then servant
  to a Mr. Lancaster of Blakehills, the next house to Wilton Hill, was
  walking a little above the house in the evening, about half-past seven,
  when on looking towards Southerfell he saw a troop of men on horseback,
  riding on the mountain side in pretty close ranks, and at the speed of a
  brisk walk. He looked earnestly at this appearance for some time before
  he ventured to acquaint any one with what he saw, remembering the
  ridicule he had brought on himself by relating his former vision. At
  length satisfied of its reality, he went into the house and told his
  master he had something curious to show him. The master said he supposed
  Stricket wanted him to look at a bonfire (it being the custom for the
  shepherds on the eve of St. John to vie with each other for the largest
  bonfire); however, they went out together, and before Stricket spoke of
  or pointed to the phenomenon, Mr. Lancaster himself observed it, and when
  they found they both saw alike, they summoned the rest of the family, who
  all came, and all saw the visionary horsemen. There were many troops, and
  they seemed to come from the lower part of the fell, becoming first
  visible at a place called Knott; they then moved in regular order in a
  curvilinear path along the side of the fell, until they came opposite to
  Blakehills, when they went over the mountain and disappeared. The last,
  or last but one, in every troop, galloped to the front, and then took the
  swift walking pace of the rest. The spectators saw all alike these
  changes in relative position, and at the same time, as they found on
  questioning each other when any change took place. The phenomenon was
  also seen by every person at every cottage within a mile; and from the
  time that Stricket first observed it, the appearance lasted two hours and
  a half, viz. from half-past seven until night prevented any further view.
  Blakehills lay only half a mile from the place of this extraordinary
  appearance. Such are the circumstances as related in Clarke's <i>Survey
  of the Lakes</i> (fol. 1789), and he professes to give this account in
  the words of Mr. Lancaster, by whom it was related to him, and on whose
  testimony he fully relied; and he subjoins a declaration of its truth
  signed by the eye-witnesses, William Lancaster and Daniel Stricket (who
  then lived under Skiddaw, and followed the business of an auctioneer),
  dated 21st July, 1785. Mr. Clarke remarks that the country abounds in
  fables of apparitions, but that they are never said to have been seen by
  more than one or two persons at a time, and then only for moment; and
  remembering that Speed mentions some similar appearance to have preceded
  a civil war, he hazards the supposition that the vision might prefigure
  the tumults of the rebellion of the following year.</p>

  <p>My Query is, Whether any subsequent appearance of the same kind is
  recorded to have been observed on this haunted mountain, and whether any
  attempt to account for it on principles of optical science, as applied to
  a supposed state of the atmosphere, has ever been published?</p>

  <p>One is reminded of the apparition said to have been witnessed above
  Vallambrosa early in the fourteenth century. Rogers, after mentioning in
  the canto on "Florence and Pisa," in his <i>Italy</i>, that Petrarch,
  when an infant of seven months old (<span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1305),
  narrowly escaped drowning in a flood of the Arno, on the way from
  Florence to Ancisa, whither his mother was retiring with him, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A most extraordinary deluge, accompanied by signs and prodigies,
  happened a few years afterwards. 'On that night,' says Giovanni Villani
  (xi. 2.), 'a hermit, being at prayer in his hermitage above Vallambrosa,
  heard a furious trampling as of many horses; and crossing himself and
  hurrying to the wicket, saw a multitude of infernal horsemen, all black
  and terrible, riding by at full speed. When, in the name of God, he
  demanded their purpose, one replied, We are going, if it be His pleasure,
  to drown the city of Florence for its wickedness. This account,' he adds,
  'was given me by the Abbot of Vallambrosa, who had questioned the holy
  man himself.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This vision, however, without doubting the holy man's veracity, may, I
  presume, be considered wholly subjective.</p>

<h3>MEDIÆVAL OR MIDDLE AGES.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 469.)</p>

  <p>The question there put by L. T. is still constantly asked, and the
  answer given by a reference to Mr. Dowling's work may perhaps be
  unsatisfactory to many, as not sufficiently defining the period at which
  the Middle Ages may be said to terminate. By some of the best historical
  writers, the commencement and termination are variously stated. In a work
  recently published by George T. Manning, entitled <i>Outlines of the
  History of the Middle Ages</i>, with heads of analysis, &amp;c., the
  Querist seems answered with more precision. Mr. Manning divides General
  History into <i>three</i> great divisions&mdash;Ancient History, that of
  the Middle Ages, and Modern History; the first division extending from
  the Creation to about four hundred years after the birth of Christ; the
  second from <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 400 to the close of the
  fifteenth century of the Christian era; the third embracing those ages
  which have elapsed since the close of mediæval times.</p>

  <p>The Middle Age portions he divides into <i>five</i> great periods,
  denoted by the vast changes which took place in the course of that
  history, viz.:</p>

  </div>

  <p>The doubling of the Cape of Good Hope being the last important event,
  which he places in 1497.</p>

  <p>This is nearly the same view as taken by M. Lamé Fleury, who commences
  with the fall of the Western Empire in 476, and closes with the conquest
  of Granada by the Spaniards in 1492: thinking that memorable event, which
  terminated in a degree the struggle of the Western against the Eastern
  Empire, a better limit ("une limite plus rigoureusement exacte") than the
  taking of Constantinople by Mahomet II. in 1453, the date when this
  historical period is generally terminated by most writers.</p>

<h3>"GRINDLE."</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 107.)</p>

  <p>The question of C. G. supplies a new instance of an ancient and heroic
  word still surviving in a local name. The only other places in England
  that I have as yet heard of are, <i>Grindleton</i> in the West Riding of
  Yorkshire, and a <i>Gryndall</i> in the East Riding. The authority for
  this latter is Mr. Williams' Translation of Leo's <i>Anglo-Saxon
  Names</i>, p. 7., note 3.</p>

  <p>In old England, the name was probably not uncommon: it occurs in a
  description of landmarks in Kemble's <i>Codex Dipl.</i>, vol. ii. p.
  172.: "on <i>grendles</i> mere."</p>

  <p>There is a peculiar interest attaching to this word; or, I might say,
  it is invested with a peculiar horror, as being the name of the malicious
  fiend, the man-enemy whom Beowulf subdues in our eldest national
  Epic:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"W&#x1E3;s se grimma gæst Grendel háten,</p>
      <p>M&#x1E3;re mearc-stapa, se þe móras heóld,</p>
      <p>Fen and fæsten&mdash;fífel-cynnes eard</p>
      <p>Won-sæli wer...."</p>
      <p class="i2"><i>Beowulf</i>, l. 203. <i>seqq.</i>&mdash;Ed. Kemble.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>So he is introduced in the poem, when, in the dead of night, he comes
  to the hall where the warriors are asleep, ravining for the human prey.
  The following is something like the meaning of the lines:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>Dread master he of waste and moor,</p>
      <p>The fen his fastness&mdash;<i>fiends among</i>,</p>
      <p>Bliss-bereft...."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This awful being was no doubt in the mind of those who originated the
  name <i>grendles mere</i>, before quoted from Kemble. The name is applied
  to a locality quite in keeping with the ancient mythological character of
  <i>Grendel</i>, who held the moor and the fen. Most strikingly does the
  same sentiment appear in the name of that strange and wildering valley of
  the Bernese Oberland, in Switzerland:&mdash;I mean the valley of
  Grindelwald, with its two awful glaciers.</p>

  <p>But when we come to consider the etymology of the name, we are led to
  an object which seems inadequate, and incapable of acting as the vehicle
  for these deep and natural sentiments of the inhuman and the
  horrible.</p>

  <p><i>Grendel</i> means, originally, no more than a <i>bar</i> or
  <i>rod</i>, or a palisade or lattice-work made of such bars or rods. Also
  a bar or bolt for fastening a door, or for closing a harbour. Middle-aged
  people at Zurich recollect when the old "Grindel" was still standing at
  the mouth of their river. This was a tremendous bar, by which the
  water-approach to their town could be closed against an enemy; who might
  otherwise pass from the Lake of Zurich down the river Limmat, into the
  heart of the town of Zurich.</p>

  <p>It was in Germany that this word lived longest as a common
  substantive. There is no known instance of it in Anglo-Saxon, other than
  in proper names, and of these I know no more than are already enumerated
  above; whereas, in the Middle High German, it is by no means uncommon. It
  occurs in a mystery on the resurrection preserved in this dialect, and
  edited by Ettmüller, 1851 (<i>Dat Spil fan der Upstandinge</i>). I cannot
  now find the line, but it is used there for "the gates of hell." Cf. also
  Ziemann's <i>Mittelhochdeutsches Wörterbuch</i>, voc. <span
  class="sc">Grindel</span>.</p>

  <p>Grimm, in his <i>Mythology</i>, establishes a connexion between
  <i>Grendel</i> and <i>Loki</i>, the northern half-deity half-demon, the
  origin of evil. He was always believed to have cunningly guided the shaft
  of Flöder the Blind, who, in loving sport, shot his brother Balder the
  Gay, the beloved of gods and men. So entered sorrow into the hitherto
  unclouded Asaland.</p>

  <p>Grimm draws attention to the circumstance that Loki is apparently
  connected with the widespread root which appears in English in the forms
  <i>lock</i> and <i>latch</i>. Here is a very striking analogy, <!-- Page
  308 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page308"></a>{308}</span>and it is
  supported by an instance from the present German: <i>Höllriegel</i> =
  vectis infernalis, brand of hell, is still recognised as = <i>teufel</i>;
  or for an old witch = devil's dam.</p>

  <p>And even in Latin documents we find the same idea represented. Thus,
  in a charter of King Edgar (<i>Cod. Dipl.</i>, No. 487.), which begins
  with a recital of the fall of man, and the need of escaping the
  consequent misery, we have the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Quamobrem ego Eadgar, totius Britanniæ gubernator et rector, ut hujus
  miseriæ <i>repagulum</i> quam protoplastus inretitus promeruit ...
  evadere queam, quandam ruris particulam ... largitus sum," &amp;c.
  &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As to the application of this name to localities, it seems to
  represent the same sentiment as the prefix of Giant, Grim, or Devil: and
  this sentiment would be that of the grand or awful in Nature, and
  mysterious or unaccountable in artificial works. I think we may then
  safely conclude, that all dikes, ditches, camps, cromlechs, &amp;c.,
  which have such titles attached to them, date from an age previous to the
  Saxons being in England. For example, if we did not know from other
  sources the high antiquity of Wayland Smith's Cave in Berkshire, we might
  argue that it was at least pre-Saxon; from the fact that the Saxons
  called it by the name of their Vulcan, and therefore that it appeared to
  them so mysterious as to be <i>dignus vindice nodus</i>.</p>

  <p>If your correspondent C. G., or any of your readers, can, either from
  their reading or from local knowledge, add any further illustrations or
  examples of this ancient heathen word, I, for one, shall receive them
  gratefully.</p>

<h3>MUMMIES OF ECCLESIASTICS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., pp. 53. 110. 205. 328.)</p>

  <p>Although I have myself seen the natural mummies preserved at Kreuzberg
  on the Rhine, I can say nothing more with regard to them, than vouch for
  the accuracy of the accounts transmitted by your various correspondents
  under this head. Your Querist A. A. however may, if curious on this
  subject, be referred with advantage to Mr. T. J. Pettigrew's interesting
  <i>History of Egyptian Mummies</i>. In chap. xvii. of this work, many
  instances are adduced of the preservation of bodies from putrefaction by
  the desiccating properties of the natural air of the place in which they
  are contained. He says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In dry, and particularly calcareous vaults, bodies may be preserved
  for a great length of time. In Toulouse, bodies are to be seen quite
  perfect, although buried two centuries ago. In the vaults of St.
  Michael's Church, Dublin, the same effect is produced; and Mr. Madden
  says he there saw the body of Henry Shears, who was hanged in 1798, in a
  state of preservation equal to that of any Egyptian mummy."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Garcilasso de la Veya, and more recent historians, may be referred to
  for accounts of the mummy-pits of Peru, the dry air of which country is
  an effectual preventive of the process of putrefaction. One of the most
  curious spectacles, however, of this nature is to be found in the
  Catacombs of Palermo, where the traveller finds himself in the midst of
  some thousands of unburied bodies, which, suspended mostly by the neck,
  have become so distorted in form and feature in the process of
  desiccation, as to provoke an irrepressible smile in the midst of more
  solemn and befitting contemplations. (Sonnini's <i>Travels</i>, vol. i.
  p. 47.; Smyth's <i>Memoirs of Sicily and its Islands</i>, p. 88.)</p>

  <p>Similar properties are also attributed to the air of the western
  islands of Scotland. "To return to our purpose," says P. Camerarius
  (<i>The Living Librarie</i>, translated by Molle, folio, London, 1625, p.
  47.),&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That which Abraham Ortelius reporteth after Gyrald de Cambren is
  wonderfull, that the bodies of men rot not after their decease, in the
  isles of Arran; and that therefore they bee not buried, but left in the
  open ayr, where putrefaction doth them no manner of hurt; whereby the
  families (not without amazement) doe know their fathers, grandfathers,
  great-grandfathers, and a long race of their predecessors. Peter Martyr,
  a Milannois, saith the same of some West Indians of Comagra. These bee
  his words: 'The Spaniards being entered the lodgings of this Cacick,
  found a chamber fulle of dead bodies, hanging by ropes of cotton, and
  asking what superstition that was, they received this answer, That those
  were the fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers of the Cacick of
  Comagra. The Indians say that they keep such relikes preciously, and that
  the ceremonie is one of the points of their religion. According to his
  qualities while he lived, his bodie, being dead, is richly decked with
  jewels and precious stones.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Many other instances might be adduced, but you will now think that at
  least enough has been said on this subject.</p>

<h3>VICARS-APOSTOLIC IN ENGLAND.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., pp. 125. 297. 400.; Vol. vii., pp. 242. 243.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent A. S. A. seems very anxious to possess a complete
  list of the vicars-apostolic of England. With their names, and the date
  of their consecration and death, collected from various sources, I am
  able to supply him.</p>

  <p>The last survivor of the Roman Catholic bishops consecrated in England
  prior to the reign of Elizabeth was Dr. Thomas Watson, appointed bishop
  of Lincoln in 1557 by Queen Mary, and deprived (on the accession of
  Elizabeth) in 1559. <!-- Page 309 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page309"></a>{309}</span></p>

  <p>Upon his death, in 1584, the Catholic clergy in England were left
  without a head, and the Pope some time after appointed an
  <i>arch-priest</i>, to superintend them, and the following persons filled
  the office:</p>

  <p>On the death of the latter the episcopate was revived by the pope in
  England, and one bishop was consecrated as head of the English
  Catholics.</p>

<h3>BANBURY ZEAL, ETC.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 106.)</p>

  <p>I have no doubt that the particular instance of <i>Zeal in the cause
  of the Church</i> at Banbury, which Addison had in mind when he wrote No.
  220. of the <i>Tatler</i>, published Sept. 5, 1710, was a grand
  demonstration made by its inhabitants in favour of Dr. Sacheverell, whose
  trial had terminated in his acquittal on March 23 of that year. And my
  opinion is strengthened by the introduction almost immediately afterwards
  of a passage on the party use of the terms High Church and Low
  Church.</p>

  <p>On June 3, 1710, the High Church champion made a triumphal entry into
  Banbury, which is ridiculed in a pamphlet called <i>The Banb..y Apes, or
  the Monkeys chattering to the Magpye; in a Letter to a Friend in
  London</i>. On the back of the title is large woodcut, representing the
  procession which accompanied the doctor; among the personages of which
  the Mayor of Banbury (as a wolf), and the aldermen (as apes), are
  conspicuous figures. Dr. Sacheverell himself appears on horseback,
  followed by a crowd of persons bearing crosses and rosaries, or strewing
  branches. The accompanying letter-press describes this procession as
  being closed by twenty-four tinkers beating on their kettles, and a "vast
  mob, hollowing, hooping, and playing the devil." There is another tract
  on the same subject, which is extremely scarce, entitled&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"An Appeal from the City to the Country for the Preservation of Her

  Ben Jonson, in his <i>Bartholomew Fair</i>, written 1614; where he
  introduces "Zeal-of-the-Land Busy" as "a Banbury Man," who "was a
  <i>baker</i>&mdash;but he does dream now, and see visions: he has given
  over his trade, out of a scruple he took, that, in spiced conscience,
  <i>those cakes he made</i> were served to bridales, maypoles, morrisses,
  and such profane feasts and meetings." I do not know whether the sale of
  Banbury cakes flourished in the last century; but I find recorded in
  Beesley's <i>Hist. of Banbury</i> (published 1841) that Mr. Samuel
  Beesley sold in 1840 no fewer than 139,500 twopenny cakes; and in 1841,
  the sale had increased by at least a fourth. In Aug. 1841, 5,400 were
  sold weekly; being shipped to America, India, and even Australia. I fancy
  their celebrity in early days can hardly parallel this, but I do not
  vouch for the statistics.</p>

<h3>DR. SOUTH VERSUS GOLDSMITH, TALLEYRAND, ETC.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 575.)</p>

  <p>This remarkable saying, like most good things of that kind, has been
  repeated by so many distinguished writers, that it is impossible to trace
  it to any one in particular, in the precise form in which it is now
  popularly received. I shall quote, in succession, all those who appear to
  have expressed it in words of the same, or a nearly similar, import, and
  then leave your readers to judge for themselves.</p>

  <p>I cannot help thinking that the first place should be assigned to
  Jeremy Taylor, as he must have had the sentiment clearly in view in the
  following sentence:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is in mankind an universal contract implied in all their
  intercourses; and <i>words being instituted to declare the mind, and for
  no other end</i>, he that hears me speak hath a right in justice to be
  done him, that, as far as I can, what I speak be true; for else he by
  words does not know your mind, and then as good and better not speak at
  all."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Next we have David Lloyd, who in his <i>State Worthies</i> thus
  remarks of Sir Roger Ascham:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"None is more able for, yet none is more averse to, that
  circumlocution and contrivance wherewith some men shadow their main drift
  and purpose. <i>Speech was made to open man to man, and not to hide
  him</i>; to promote commerce, and not betray it."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Dr. South, Lloyd's cotemporary, but who survived him more than twenty
  years, expresses the sentiment in nearly the same words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In short, this seems to be the true inward judgment of all our
  politick sages, that <i>speech was given to the ordinary sort of men,
  whereby to communicate their mind, but to wise men whereby to conceal
  it</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The next writer in whom this thought occurs is Butler, the author of
  <i>Hudibras</i>. In one of his prose essays on the "Modern Politician,"
  he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He (the modern politician) believes a man's words and his meanings
  should never agree together: for he that says what he thinks lays himself
  open to be expounded by the most ignorant; and <i>he who does not make
  his words rather serve to conceal than discover the sense of his
  heart</i>, deserves to have it pulled out, like a traitor's, and shown
  publicly to the rabble."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Young has the thought in the following couplet on the duplicity of
  courts:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"When Nature's end of language is declin'd,</p>
      <p>And men talk only to <i>conceal their mind</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>From Young it passed to Voltaire, who in the dialogue entitled "Le
  Chapon et la Poularde," makes the former say of the treachery of men:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ils n'emploient les paroles que pour <i>déguiser leurs
  pensées</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Goldsmith, about the same time, in his paper in <i>The Bee</i>,
  produces it in the well-known words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Men who know the world hold that the true use of speech is not so
  much to <i>express</i> our wants, as to <i>conceal</i> them."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Then comes Talleyrand, who is reported to have said:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"La parole n'a été donnée à l'homme que pour <i>déguiser sa
  pensée</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The latest writer who adopts this remark without acknowledgment is, I
  believe, Lord Holland. In his <i>Life of Lope de Vega</i> he says of
  certain Spanish writers, promoters of the <i>cultismo</i> style:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"These authors do not avail themselves of the invention of letters for
  the purpose of <i>conveying, but of concealing, their ideas</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From these passages (some of which have already appeared in Vol. i.,
  p. 83) it will be seen that the germ of the thought occurs in Jeremy
  Taylor; that Lloyd and South improved upon it; that Butler, Young and
  Goldsmith repeated it; that Voltaire translated it into French; that
  Talleyrand echoed Voltaire's words; and that it has now become so
  familiar an expression, that any one may quote it, as Lord Holland has
  done, without being at the trouble of giving his authority.</p>

  <p>If, from the search for the author, we turn to consider the saying
  itself, we shall find that its practical application extends not merely
  to every species of equivocation, mental reservation, and even falsehood;
  but comprises certain forms of speech, which are intended to convey the
  <i>contrary</i> of what they express. To this class of words the French
  have given the designation of <i>contre-vérité</i>; and, to my surprise,
  I find that they include therein the expression <i>amende honorable</i>.
  Upon this point the <i>Grammaire des Grammaires</i>, by Girault Duvivier,
  has these remarks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"La contre-vérité a beaucoup de rapport avec l'ironie. Amende
  honorable, par exemple, est une contre-vérité, une vérité prise dans un
  sens opposé à celui de son énonciation; car, au lieu d'être honorable,
  elle est infamante, déshonorante."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have some doubts as to whether this meaning of <i>amende
  honorable</i> be in accordance with our English notion of its import; and
  I shall be thankful to any of your readers who will help me to a
  solution. I always understood that the term <i>honorable</i>, in this
  expression, was to be taken in its literal sense, namely, that the person
  who made an open avowal of his fault, or tendered an apology for it, was
  acting, <i>in that respect</i>, in strict conformity with the rules of
  honour. It is possible that, at first, the <i>amende honorable</i> may
  have been designed as a "peine infamante;" but its modern acceptation
  would seem to admit of a more liberal construction. <!-- Page 312
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page312"></a>{312}</span></p>

  <p>There are other expressions, framed upon this "lucus a non lucendo"
  principle, which may fairly be classed among <i>contre-vérités</i>. The
  French say that a thing is <i>à propos de bottes</i>, when it is
  altogether inappropriate. We all use the formula of "your most obedient,
  humble servant," even when we intend anything but humility or
  obedience.</p>

<h3>IRISH RHYMES.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., pp. 431. 539. 605.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Cuthbert Bede</span> (Vol. vi., p. 605.) says "he
  thinks A. B. R. would have to search a long time, before he found, in the
  pages of Pope, such brogue-inspired rhymes as <i>rake well</i> and
  <i>sequel</i>, <i>starve it</i> and <i>deserve it</i>, <i>charge ye</i>
  and <i>clergy</i>, and others quoted by him at p. 431." Among the latter,
  I presume he chiefly relies on the rhymes <i>satire</i> and <i>hater</i>,
  <i>creature</i> and <i>nature</i>.</p>

  <p>Of all these I am able to adduce parallel instances both from Dryden
  and Pope. And first, as to <i>rake well</i> and <i>sequel</i>. <span
  class="sc">Mr. Bede</span> is, of course, aware that these are double
  rhymes; that <i>quel</i> and <i>well</i> are good English rhymes; and
  that the brogue betrays itself only in the first syllable of each,
  <i>rake</i> and <i>se</i>. It is, in fact, the same sort of rhyme as
  <i>break</i> and <i>weak</i>, which is of such frequent occurrence both
  in Dryden and Pope. Here is an example from each:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Or if they should, their interest soon would <i>break</i>,</p>
      <p>And with such odious aid make David <i>weak</i>."</p>
      <p class="i10"><i>Absalom and Achitophel.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Men in their loose, unguarded hours they <i>take</i>;</p>
      <p>Not that themselves are wise, but others <i>weak</i>."</p>
      <p class="i10"><i>Essay on Man.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The next "brogue-inspired rhyme" is <i>starve it</i> and <i>deserve
  it</i>. Here, as in the former instance, the last syllables rhyme
  correctly, and the objection is confined to <i>starve</i> and
  <i>deserve</i>. Let us see what Dryden says to this:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Wrong conscience, or no conscience, may <i>deserve</i></p>
      <p>To thrive, but ours alone is privileged to <i>starve</i>."</p>
      <p class="i10"><i>Hind and Panther.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And Pope:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"But still the great have kindness in <i>reserve</i>:</p>
      <p>He help'd to bury whom he help'd to <i>starve</i>."</p>
      <p class="i10"><i>Prologue to the Satires.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Of this species of rhyme I have noted <i>three other</i> instances in
  Dryden, and <i>two</i> in Pope.</p>

  <p>As regards the rhyme <i>charge ye</i> and <i>clergy</i>, no instance,
  in the same words, occurs in Dryden or Pope. They did not write much in
  that sort of doggerel. But the brogue, even here, is nothing more than
  the confounding of the sounds of <i>a</i> and <i>e</i>, which is so
  beautifully exemplified in the following couplet in Dryden:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"For yet no George, to our <i>discerning</i>,</p>
      <p>Has writ without a ten years' warning."</p>
      <p class="i10"><i>Epistle to Sir G. Etheredge.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Next, we have the rhyme <i>satire</i> and <i>hater</i>. The following
  in Dryden is quite as bad, if not worse:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Spiteful he is not, though he wrote a <i>satire</i>,</p>
      <p>For still there goes some thinking to <i>ill-nature</i>."</p>
      <p class="i10"><i>Absalom and Achitophel.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Of this rhyme <i>satire</i> and <i>nature</i>, I can adduce two other
  instances from Dryden.</p>

  <p>In the same category we must place <i>nature</i> and <i>creature</i>,
  <i>nature</i> and <i>feature</i>. Here is an example from Dryden; and I
  can bring forward two others:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A proof that chance alone makes every <i>creature</i></p>
      <p>A very Killigrew without good <i>nature</i>."</p>
      <p class="i10"><i>Essay upon Satire.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And here is one from Pope:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"'Tis a virgin hard of <i>feature</i>,</p>
      <p>Old and void of all good <i>nature</i>."</p>
      <p class="i10"><i>Answer to "What is Prudery?"</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Can <span class="sc">Mr. Bede</span> produce anything to match the
  following sample of the <i>crater</i>, to be found in our most polished
  English poet?</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Alas! if I am such a <i>creature</i>,</p>
      <p>To grow the worse for growing <i>greater</i>!"</p>
      <p class="i10"><i>Dialogue between Pope and Craggs.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It will be seen, from the foregoing quotations, that the rhymes
  described as Irish were, a century and a half ago, common to both
  countries,&mdash;a fact which <span class="sc">Mr. Bede</span> was
  probably not sufficiently aware of when he introduced the subject in "N.
  &amp; Q." For obvious reasons, the use of such rhymes, at the present
  day, would be open to the imputation of "Irishism;" but it was not so in
  the days of Swift.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Henry H. Breen.</span></p>

  <p class="address">St. Lucia.</p>

  <p>In a former Number I drew attention to that peculiar fondness for
  "Irish rhymes" which is more evident in Swift than in any other poet; and
  another correspondent afterwards gave examples to show that "our premier
  poet, Pope," sometimes tripped in the same Hibernian manner. In looking
  over an old volume of the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>, during the time of
  its being edited by the poet Campbell, I have stumbled upon a passage
  which is so <i>apropos</i> to the subject referred to, that I cannot
  resist quoting it; and independent of its bearing on our Irish rhyming
  discussion, the passage has sufficient interest to excuse my making a
  Note of it. It occurs in one of a series of papers called "The Family
  Journal," supposed to have been written by the immediate descendants of
  the "Will Honeycomb" of the <i>Spectator</i>. A <!-- Page 313 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page313"></a>{313}</span>dinner-party is
  assembled at Mr. Pope's, when the conversation takes this turn:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mr. Walscott asked if he (Dryden) was an Englishman or an Irishman,
  for he never could find out. 'You would find out,' answered Mr. Pope, 'if
  you heard him talk, for he cannot get rid of the habit of saying <i>a</i>
  for <i>e</i>. He would be an Englishman with all his heart, if he could;
  but he is an Irishman, that is certain, and with all his heart too in one
  sense, for he is the truest patriot that country ever saw.... You must
  not talk to him about Irish rhymes,' added Mr. Pope, 'any more than you
  must talk to me about the <i>gods</i> and <i>abodes</i> in my Homer,
  which he quarrels with me for. The truth is, we all write Irish rhymes,
  and the Dean contrives to be more exact that way than most of us.'
  'What!' said Mr. Walscott, 'does he carry his Irish accent into his
  writings, and yet think to conceal himself?' Mr. Pope read to us an odd
  kind of Latin-English effusion of the Dean's, which made us shake with
  laughter. It was about a consultation of physicians. The words, though
  Latin in themselves, make English when put together; and the Hibernianism
  of the spelling is very plain. I remember a taste of it. A doctor begins
  by inquiring,</p>

  <p>"'Is his Honor sic? Præ lætus felis pulse. It do es beat veris loto
  <i>de</i>.'</p>

  <p>"Here <i>de</i> spells <i>day</i>. An Englishman would have used the
  word <i>da</i>.</p>

  <p>"'No,' says the second doctor; 'no, notis as qui cassi e ver feltu
  metri it,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>"<i>Metri</i> for <i>may try</i>.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pope told us that there were two bad rhymes in the <i>Rape of the
  Lock</i>, and in the space of eight lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"'The doubtful beam long nods from side to side;</p>
      <p>At length the wits mount up, the hairs subside.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>But this bold lord, with manly strength endued,</p>
      <p>She with one finger and a thumb subdued.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"<i>Mr. Walscott.</i> 'These would be very good French rhymes.'</p>

  <p>"<i>Mr. Pope.</i> 'Yes, the French make a merit of necessity, and
  force their poverty upon us for riches. But it is bad in English.
  However, it is too late to alter what I wrote. I now care less about
  them, notwithstanding the Doctor. When I was a young man, I was for the
  free <i>disinvolte</i> way of Dryden, as in the <i>Essay on
  Criticism</i>; but the town preferred the style of my pastorals, and
  somehow or other I agreed with them. I then became very cautious, and
  wonder how those lines in the <i>Lock</i> escaped me. But I have come to
  this conclusion, that when a man has established his reputation for being
  able to do a thing, he may take liberties. Weakness is one thing, and the
  carelessness of power another.'"&mdash;<i>New Monthly Magazine</i>, vol.
  xiii. (1825), pp. 551, 552.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>With regard to the French rhyme, I see, in a note to <i>Odes and other
  Poems</i>, by Henry Neele, 1821, that he apologises for rhyming
  <i>multitude</i> with <i>solitude</i>, by saying:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is of that kind which is very common in French, but I fear hardly
  justified by English practice. Still, 'La rime est une esclave, et ne
  doit qu'obéir.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I would append to this Note a Query. Where in Swift's works is the
  "Latin-English effusion of the Dean's" to be met with?<a
  name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> or is it
  composed for him by the writer of the article? I only know of two such
  effusions really written by Swift; the <i>Love Song</i>, "Apud in is almi
  des ire," &amp;c., and the <i>Epigram on Dic</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Dic, heris agro at an da quarto finale</p>
      <p>Fora ringat ure nos an da stringat ure tale."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I should also like to know the author of the clever series of papers
  from which I have quoted.</p>

<h3>COUNT GONDOMAR.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 489.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">W. Stanley Simmonds</span> will
  find a lengthy account of this notable Spanish Don&mdash;Diego Sarmiento
  de Acuña, Conde de Gondomar&mdash;in the <i>Nobiliario genealogico de los
  Reyes y Titulos de España</i> of Lopez de Haro, folio, Madrid, 1622, vol.
  i. pp. 236-238. In this notice he chiefly figures, strange to say, as a
  military character! At the ripe age of <i>seventeen</i> this "famous
  captain" is said to have chastised the insolence of that bold "English
  pirate, Francisco Draques," who in 1584 had had the temerity to land
  somewhere near Bayona, his sole object being of course plunder. Don Diego
  guarded well his territory of Tuy when the same formidable "dragon," in
  the year 1589, made his appearance before Coruña; and again in 1596, when
  the English Armada visited ill-fated Cadiz. Being a person of "great
  parts," the Count was despatched to England as ambassador in 1613, and
  during the five years that he resided in this country, "the king and his
  nobility showered upon him favours and honours innumerable." He once told
  James that the flour of England (meaning the gentry) was very fine, but
  the bran (meaning the common people) was very coarse; "<i>La harina de
  Inglatierra es muy delgada y fina, pero el afrecho es muy
  grossero</i>,"&mdash;for Gondomar, like the learned Isaac Casaubon, had
  been subject to the grossest insults from the London rabble. We next find
  ranked among his praiseworthy deeds the following atrocious one:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Hizo cortar la cabeça al General Ingles Wbaltero Rale (Sir Walter
  Raleigh) por aver intentado descubrimiento en las Indias Occidentales de
  Castilla a su partida."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Another meritorious action is added:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A su instancia perdonó la Magestad de aquel Rey (James I.) a sesenta
  sacerdotes que estavan presos condenados por causa de la religion, y a
  otros mucho Catolicos, passandolos todos consigo a Flandes."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 314 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page314"></a>{314}</span></p>

  <p>The title of Count Gondomar was conferred upon him by Philip III. in
  1617, but the date of his death is still a desideratum. Many anecdotes
  concerning him are to be seen scattered in Howel's <i>Treatise of
  Ambassadors</i>.</p>

<h3>DOOR-HEAD INSCRIPTIONS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 543.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">B. B. Woodward</span> (urged, probably, by <span
  class="sc">R. Rawlinson's</span> question in Vol. vi., p. 412.) sends you
  the following inscription,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Sit mihi nec glis servus, nec hospes hirudo,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>copied from over the entrance to an old hostel in the town of
  Wymondham, Norfolk. He says he quotes from memory.</p>

  <p>Vol. vii., p. 23., you give an English translation of the
  inscription:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"From servant lazy as dormouse,</p>
      <p>Or leeching guest, God keep my house;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>but suggest that "hirudo" should be "hiru<i>n</i>do," and produce some
  apt classical quotations supposing it may be so, requesting <span
  class="sc">Mr. Woodward</span> to look again at the original
  inscription.</p>

  <p>In a recent Number (Vol. vii., p. 190.) <span class="sc">Mr.
  Woodward</span> appears to have done this, and sends you the inscriptions
  correctly (as I beg to vouch, having often read and copied it, and living
  within four miles of the spot), thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Nec mihi glis servus, nec hospes hirudo."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Permit me to add to this corroboration, that I should venture a
  different translation of the word "hospes" from your correspondent's, and
  render the notice thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Good attendance and cheap charges:"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>taking "hospes" not as guest but host, and the literal words, "My
  servant is not a dormouse, nor (I) the host a leech."</p>

  <p>Ainsworth gives authority for "hospes" meaning host as well as guest,
  and quotes Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i> in support of it.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">John P. Boileau.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Ketteringham Park, Wymondham, Norfolk.</p>

  <p>With due respect to your correspondent A. B. R., the word "hospes"
  most probably means host, not guest.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Sit mihi nec servus glis, nec hospes hirudo."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In Blomfield's <i>Norfolk</i> (but I cannot now lay my finger on the
  passage) the line is given as an inscription on the lintel of a door of
  an ancient hostelry, carved in oak. If so, the line may be
  rendered&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"No maid like dormouse on me wait,</p>
      <p>Nor leech-like host be here my fate."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But, on the supposition that <i>guest</i> is the proper meaning,
  "hirudo" might be taken in the sense of a greedy guest, although this
  would not be complimentary to the older hospitality. And even in the
  sense of gossiping, "hirudo" would not be so inappropriate an imitation
  of the "recitator acerbus" at the conclusion of the <i>Ars
  Poetica</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Nec missura cutem nisi plena cruoris hirudo."</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>Photographic Gun-Cotton.</i>&mdash;The "doctors differ" not a
  little in their prescriptions for preparing the best gun-cotton for
  photographic use. How shall the photographer decide between them?</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span> ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vi., p. 277.)
  says (I quote briefly), "<i>Pour upon</i> 100 grains of cotton an ounce
  and a half of nitric acid, previously mixed with one ounce of strong
  sulphuric acid. Knead it with glass rods <i>during five minutes</i>,"
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hunt, quoting, (apparently with approbation) from <span
  class="sc">Mr. Archer</span>, says (p. 260., 3rd edit.), "Take one ounce
  by measure of nitric acid, mixed with one ounce by measure of ordinary
  sulphuric acid, and <i>add to them</i> eighty grains of cotton; well
  stir," &amp;c., "<i>for not more than</i> <span class="sm">FIFTEEN
  SECONDS</span>," &amp;c. "It will be seen that the cotton is not exposed
  to the action of the mixed acids in this last mode longer than is
  necessary to saturate the cotton; should the action be continued further,
  the solubility of the cotton is entirely lost."</p>

  <p>Not only is the order of manipulation different (a point probably not
  material), but the time between "five minutes" and "fifteen seconds" must
  exercise a most important influence on the result. Who is right?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Cokely.</span></p>

  <p><i>Sealing-wax for Baths.</i>&mdash;I notice in your answers to
  correspondents (No. 176., p. 274.), that you inform <span class="sc">H.
  Henderson</span> that glass may be cemented for baths with sealing-wax.
  May I recommend to <span class="sc">H. Henderson</span> the use of gutta
  percha, instead of glass, for that purpose? Sheet gutta percha is now
  very cheap, and the baths are most easily made. I have had one of my own
  making in constant use since last July, having never emptied it but
  twice, to filter the nitrate of silver solution. It is not liable to
  breakage. The joinings are much less liable to leakage. And when it is
  necessary to heat slightly the silver solution (as it has been during the
  late cold weather), I have adopted the following simple plan: Heat
  moderately a stout piece of plate glass; plunge it into the bath; repeat
  the operation according to the size of bath. It is very useful to make a
  gutta percha cap to cover over the bath when not in use; it protects it
  from dust and evaporation, and saves the continual loss of materials
  arising from pouring the solution backwards and forwards. For home-work I
  have reduced <!-- Page 315 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page315"></a>{315}</span>the whole operation to a very simple
  system. My bath, hypo-soda, developing fluid (of which, as it keeps so
  long, I make ten ounces at a time), are always ready in a small closet in
  my study. These I arrange on my study-table: a gutta percha tray, a brass
  levelling-stand upon it, a jug of soft water, and half-a-dozen small
  plates to place my pictures on, after treating them with the
  hypo-solution (for, to save time, I do not finish washing them until I
  have done all the pictures I require). All these things I can prepare and
  arrange in less than ten minutes, and can as easily return them to their
  places afterwards.</p>

  <p>With regard to <span class="sc">Mr. Mabley's</span> process, described
  in "N. &amp; Q.," No. 176., p. 267., as I am but a beginner myself, and
  have much to learn, I should be sorry to condemn it; but I should fear
  that his pictures would not exhibit sufficient contrast in the tints. Nor
  do I see the advantage the pictures would possess, if they did, over
  positives taken by our process. We amateurs in the country labour at
  present under great disadvantages, some of which I think the Photographic
  Society will remove. I am myself quite unable to form an idea what the
  collodion pictures done by first-rate photographers are like. All the
  positives done by amateurs in this part of the world, and developed by
  pyrogallic acid, which I have seen, present a dirty brown hue, by no
  means pleasing or artistic; and I have seen but very few, either
  developed by pyrogallic acid or protosulphate of iron, free from
  blemishes. I think if we were to act upon the suggestion made in "N.
  &amp; Q." some time back, and send the editor a specimen of our
  performances, it would be a slight return for his endeavours in our
  behalf; and he would, I doubt not, honestly tell us whether our pictures
  were tolerable or not. I, for one, shall be very happy to do so.</p>

  <p><i>Developing Chamber.</i>&mdash;I think <span class="sc">Mr.
  Sisson</span> will find some difficulty in applying his very excellent
  idea of a sheet India rubber lighting medium to his portable laboratory,
  as the vapour of the ether will act upon it and render it sticky and
  useless after one or two usings. Allow me to suggest what I am in the
  habit of using, viz. a double layer of yellow glazed calico, stuck
  together with a little common drying oil, and allowed to dry for a few
  days: this causes a perfect exclusion of the actinic rays, and is very
  durable.</p>

  <p><i>The Black Tints on Photographic Positives.</i>&mdash;A
  correspondent having inquired how these were obtained, and another
  replying that it was caused by starch, I beg to offer a process to your
  readers as to how they may obtain those carbonic tints; though I must
  premise that the process requires some skill, and is not always
  successful, though always sure to make them black: but on occasions of
  failure the lights sink, and the brilliancy of the picture is lost. That
  it is not starch in the French process, unless that vehicle contains some
  preparation, I am tolerably certain; the chloride of barium will often
  produce black images, though very uncertain; and the black process as
  given by Le Gray is uncertain also. For myself, I generally prefer the
  colour given by ammoniac salt; it is artistical and sufficient for any
  purpose. The present process, which I use myself when I require a black
  colour, with its imperfections, I offer to the photographic readers of
  "N. &amp; Q.," and here it is.</p>

  <p>Take a two-ounce vial, and have some powdered litharge of lead, by
  some called gold or scale litharge; pound it fine in a Wedgewood mortar,
  and put in the vial about one scruple; pour on it about half an ounce of
  Beaufoy's acetic acid, but do not replace the cork or stopper, as the gas
  evolved is very active, and will burst the vial, placing the operator's
  eyes in jeopardy; agitate and allow it to stand some hours to settle, or
  leave it till next day, when it will be better for the purpose: then
  decant the clear part and throw the fæces away, return the solution into
  the bottle, and fill up with distilled water. The positive paper being
  now prepared with the ammonio-nitrate of silver, and placed as usual in
  the sun, the artist must remove it when a tolerably distinct image is
  visible, but not altogether up: this is <i>one</i> of the niceties of the
  process; if it is too much done the blacks will be too black, and if not
  enough they will be feeble and want richness; it is when a visible image
  of the whole is developed: at this point put the positive into cold
  water; this will remove a great deal of the silver that has not been
  acted upon by the light: let it soak three or four minutes; take it out
  and blot off the water, laying a clean piece of paper below. Now pour a
  small quantity of the solution of lead on one end, and with a glass rod
  pass it carefully over every part; blot it off, and giving the paper a
  little time to dry partially, pass over a solution of newly made gallic
  acid; the shadows will rapidly become perfectly blank, and the picture
  will come up. But <i>another</i> nicety in the process is the point at
  which it must be plunged into hyposulphite of soda solution; if plunged
  in too soon the black will be mingled with the sepia tints, and if too
  late the whole tint will be too black. I offer it, however, because I
  know its capabilities of improvement, and the intensity of the black is
  sometimes beautiful: it is better suited for architectural subjects,
  where there is but little sky, as it will lay a faint tint over it; but
  if a sky is attempted, it must be kept under by a brush with a little
  hyposulphite of soda solution, touching it <!-- Page 316 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page316"></a>{316}</span>carefully. The time it
  will take in becoming black will not exceed one minute; but as the
  eyesight is the guide, the moment the tints have changed from red to
  black is the proper time to arrest its further progress: the combination
  thus obtained will not change, nor, I believe, become faint by time; but
  I repeat it may be much improved, and if any abler hand, or one with
  better means at his disposal, will take the trouble to examine its
  capabilities, I shall be very thankful for his notes on the subject.</p>

  <p>N.B. The solution of lead must contain acid; and if by keeping it does
  not change litmus-paper, acid must be added till it does.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Contested Elections</i> (Vol. vii., p.208.).&mdash;There is a very
  fair history of the boroughs of Great Britain, by Edwards, in 3 Vols.
  8vo., printed by Debrett in 1792.</p>

  <p class="author">J. B.</p>

  <p>X. Y. Z. is informed that a compilation on the subject to which his
  Query relates was published a few years since in Leeds by Henry Stooks
  Smith. Speaking from recollection, it appears to be a work of some
  research; but I cannot say how far it is to be relied on. It may,
  perhaps, be one of the unfortunate works which have already fallen under
  his censure.</p>

  <p><i>Suicide at Marseilles</i> (Vol. vii., p. 180.).&mdash;In
  Montaigne's <i>Essays</i> I find,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In former times there was kept, in our city of Marseilles, a poison
  prepared out of hemlock, at the public charge, for those who had a mind
  to hasten their end, having first, before the Six Hundred, which were
  their Senate, given an account of the reasons and motives of their
  design; and it was not otherwise lawful than by leave from the
  magistrate, and upon just occasion, to do violence to themselves. The
  same law was also in use in other places."&mdash;Book ii. chap. iii., at
  end.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This, however, is not the original authority required by your
  correspondent.</p>

  <p>In the earlier part of the same chapter, "Plutarch, <i>On the Virtuous
  Deeds of Women</i>," is referred to as the authority for the statement
  which Montaigne makes of</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Milesian virgins, that by an insane compact hanged themselves,

  the bodies of such as should be found so hanged should be drawn by the

  <p><i>Acts</i>, xv. 23. (Vol. vii., p. 204.).&mdash;From the notes to
  Tischendorf's <i>Greek Testament</i>, it appears that <span title="kai hoi" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76; &#x1F41;&iota;</span> is omitted by Griesbach ed.
  <span class="sm">II.</span> anno 1806, as well as by Lachman, on the
  authority of the four most ancient Greek MSS. distinguished as A, B, C,
  and D, confirmed by the versio Armenica, and so quoted by Athanasius,
  Irenæus, Pacian, and Vigilius. The MS. A is referred by Tischendorf to
  the latter half of the fifth century, and is the Alexandrian MS. in the
  British Museum. B is the Vatican codex of about the middle of the fourth
  century. C the codex Ephraemi Syri rescriptus at Paris, and is of the
  first half of the fifth century; and D is Beza's MS. at Cambridge, of
  about the middle of the sixth century. <span class="sc">Mr. Sansom</span>
  may find a very interesting letter upon this subject from Dr. Tregelles
  to Dr. Charles Wordsworth, the present Bishop of St. Andrew's, which was
  published <i>very recently</i> in the <i>Scottish Ecclesiastical
  Journal</i>, and in which that learned critic defends the omission of the
  <span title="kai hoi" class="grk">&kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76;
  &#x1F41;&iota;</span>. I regret that I cannot furnish him with the number
  of that Journal, but it was not more than three or four back.</p>

  <p>I hope that <span class="sc">Mr. Sansom</span> will inform your
  readers of the ultimate result of his inquiries on this interesting
  subject.</p>

  <p><i>Serpent's Tongue</i> (Vol. vi., p. 340.).&mdash;The <i>Lingua
  Serpentina</i> of old MSS., and the fossil now commonly termed a
  Shark's-tooth. In former days, few pilgrims returned from the East
  without bringing at least one of those curious stones. Being principally
  found in Malta, it was said they were the tongues of the vipers, which
  once infested that island, and which St. Paul had turned into stone.
  Considered to be antidotes, and possessed of talismanic qualities, they
  were set in cups, dishes, knife-handles, and other requisites for the
  table.</p>

  <p><i>Croxton or Crostin of Lancashire</i> (Vol. vii., p. 108.).&mdash;A
  full account of the parish of Croston (not Crostin), which was formerly
  very extensive, but is now divided into the six parishes of Croston,
  Chorley, Hesketh, Hoole, Rumford, and Tarleton, may be found in Baines's
  <i>Lancashire</i>, vol. iii. pp. 395. to 440. There does not appear to
  have been a family of Croston of any note, though the name is common in
  the county. In Burke's <i>Heraldic Dictionary</i>, I find three families
  named Croxton; the principal one being of Croxton in Cheshire, since

  <p><i>Robert Dodsley</i> (Vol. vii., p. 237.).&mdash;In the <i>Biographia

  Mansfield, in Nottinghamshire, <i>as it is supposed</i>;" and this
  supposition was, <!-- Page 317 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><i>Lord Goring</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 22. 65.; Vol. vii., p.
  143.).&mdash;In the order-books of the council of state, I find that
  William Killegrew was, on the 1st Oct., 1642, appointed
  lieutenant-colonel of the regiment of Colonel Goringh, <i>vice</i> Thomas
  Hollis, deceased; and that, on the 26th March, 1647, he was named colonel
  of the same regiment, vice Colonel Goringh, resigned. That the
  last-mentioned colonel is <i>George</i> Goringh we learn from the
  war-budget (Staat van Oorlog) of 1644, where the salaries of</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td> Colonel George Goringh</td>
<td class="ar pl2"> iij<sup>c</sup>£</td></tr>
<tr><td> William Killegre, Lieutenant-Colonel</td>
<td class="ar pl2"> lxxx£</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>are charged on the province of Holland. It nowhere appears from
  official reports that Lord Goring held a higher military rank than that
  of colonel in the Netherlands army. That he left England previous to 1645
  is proved not only by the above, but also by his presence, as colonel in
  the service of Spain, at the siege of Breda in 1637. If he afterwards
  served in the Spanish army as lieutenant-general, what could have induced
  him at a later period to accept the rank of colonel in the army of the
  States?</p>

  <p>In the <i>Irish Compendium, or Rudiments of Honour</i>, vol. iii. pp.
  64, 65., 2nd ed.: London, 1727, we read that Lord Richard Boyle, born in
  1566, married as second wife "Catharine, only daughter to Sir Jeffry
  Fenton; by her had five sons and seven daughters, of which the Lady
  Lettice was married to <i>George Lord Goring</i>."&mdash;V. D. N. <i>From

  <p><i>Chaplains to Noblemen</i> (Vol. vii., p. 163.).&mdash;There is, in
  the Faculty Office in Doctors' Commons, an entry kept of the appointments
  of chaplains when brought to be registered. Under what authority the
  entry is made does not seem very clear. The register does not extend
  beyond the year 1730, though there may be amongst the records of the
  office in St. Paul's some earlier notices of similar appointments.</p>

  <p><i>The Duke of Wellington Maréchal de France</i> (Vol. vii., p.
  283.).&mdash;The Duke of Wellington is indebted to the writer in the
  <i>Revue Britannique</i> for his dukedom and bâton of France, and not to
  Garter King-at-Arms. No such titles were attributed to his Grace or
  proclaimed by Garter, as a reference to the official accounts in the
  <i>London Gazette</i> will show. The Order of St. Esprit was the only
  French honour ascribed to him; that Order he received and frequently
  wore, the insignia of which were displayed, with his numerous other
  foreign honours, at the lying-in-state. Such being the case, Garter will
  not perhaps be expected to produce the diploma for either the title of
  <i>Duc de Brunoy</i> or the rank of <i>Maréchal de France</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Lord North</i> (Vol. vii., p. 207.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr.
  Forster</span> has, it seems, blundered a piece of old scandal into an
  insinuation at once absurd and treasonable. The scandal was <i>not</i> of
  Lord Guilford and the Princess Dowager, but of Frederick Prince of Wales
  and Lady Guilford. On this I will say no more than that the supposed
  resemblance between King George III. and Lord North is very inaccurately
  described by <span class="sc">Mr. Forster</span> in almost every point
  except the <i>fair complexion</i>. The king's figure was not
  clumsy&mdash;quite the reverse, nor his face homely, nor his lips thick,
  nor his eyebrows bushy, nor his eyes protruding like Lord North's; but
  there was certainly something of a general look which might be called
  resemblance, and there was above all (which is not alluded to) the
  curious coincidence of the <i>failure of sight</i> in the latter years of
  both. Lord North was the only son of Lord Guilford's <i>first</i>
  marriage: I know not whether the children of the <i>second</i> bed
  inherited defective sight; if they did, it would remove one of the
  strongest grounds of the old suspicion.</p>

  <p><i>Mediæval Parchment</i> (Vol. vii., p. 155.).&mdash;The method of
  preparing parchment for illumination will be found in the <i>Birch and
  Sloane MSS.</i>, under "Painting and Drawing," &amp;c., where are a
  number of curious MS. instructions on the subject, written chiefly in the
  sixteenth century, in English, French, and Italian.</p>

  <p>Sir Frederic Madden, in the Introduction to <i>Illuminated
  Ornaments</i>, fol. 1833, and Mr. Ottley, in <i>Archæologia</i>, vol.
  xxiv. art. 1., have both written very minutely on the subject of
  illuminating, but their observations are too long for quotation.</p>

  <p class="author">E. G. B.</p>

  <p>I remember reading in an old French work the process used in
  illuminating parchments, and remember that the gilding was laid upon
  garlic juice; it might very possibly be diluted with proof spirits of
  wine; at all events, no parchments can bear water at whatever time they
  may have been prepared: the process of making them wear out with water
  would turn them into leather. The work I allude to was brought out, I
  recollect, under the auspices of the French Academy.</p>

  <p><i>"I hear a lion," &amp;c.</i> (Vol. vii., p. 205.).&mdash;These
  lines (corrupted by your correspondent <span class="sc">Sagitta</span>
  into <i>five</i>) are two couplets in Bramstone's lively poem of the
  <i>Art of Politics</i>. They are a versification of a shrewd question put
  by Colonel Titus in the debate on the celebrated bill for
  <i>excluding</i> James Duke of York.</p>

  <p class="author">C.</p>

  <p>The <i>Art of Politics</i>, by the Rev. Mr. Bramston, contains the
  following lines, which will, I apprehend, give your correspondent the
  required information:</p>

      <p>The trading knight with rants his speech begins,</p>
      <p>Sun, moon, and stars, and dragons, saints, and kings:</p>
      <p>But Titus said, with his uncommon sense,</p>
      <p>When the exclusion-bill was in suspense,</p>
      <p>I hear a lion in the lobby roar;</p>
      <p>Say, Mr. Speaker, shall we shut the door</p>
      <p>And keep him there, or shall we let him in</p>
      <p>To try if we can turn him out again?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Mr. Bramston's poem is in the first volume of Dodsley's

  <p><i>Fercett</i> (Vol. vi., p. 292.).&mdash;The term <i>Fercett</i> is
  probably intended as the <i>designation</i> of some collection in MS. of
  family evidences and pedigrees. It was usual among our ancestors thus to
  inscribe such collections either with the name of the collector, or that
  of the particular family to whom the book related. Thus the curious MS.
  in the library of the City of London, called <i>Dunthorne</i>, and
  containing ancient municipal records, is so called from its collector,
  whose name was Dunthorne. Instances of such titles are to be found in the
  collections of Gervase Holles in the <i>Lansdowne MSS.</i>, where one of
  such books is referred to as <i>Trusbutt</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Old Satchells</i> (Vol. vi., p. 160.; Vol. vii.,

  another and a fourth edition of <i>Old Satchells' True History</i> ("with
  copious additions, notes, and emendations," under the editorial
  superintendence of William Turnbull, Esq., F.S.A.) is in course of
  preparation 'neath the fostering care of Mr. John Gray Bell, the <i>pro
  amore</i> publisher of so many historical and antiquarian tracts of
  interest. Mr. Bell has already given to the world a <i>Pedigree of the
  Ancient Family of Scott of Stokoe</i>, edited, with notes, by William
  Robson Scott, Ph. D., of St. Leonard's, Exeter, from the original work
  compiled by his grandfather, Dr. William Scott, of Stamfordham,
  Northumberland, then (1783) representative of the family. The latter
  gentleman left behind him a large and valuable collection of MSS.
  relative to the family, which, as I learn from the prospectus, will be
  called into requisition in the forthcoming reprint of the <i>Old Souldier
  of Satchell</i>. Possibly the publishers of the second and third editions
  may have been assisted in their labours by the learned doctor in
  question, whose already quoted <i>Pedigree of the Scotts of Stokoe</i>
  was issued only a few years prior to the appearance of the Hawick edition
  of 1786, not 1784, as accidentally misprinted in J. O.'s interesting
  communication.</p>

  <p><i>The Rev. Joshua Marsden</i> (Vol. vii., p. 181.).&mdash;This
  gentleman was born at Warrington in the year 1777. In the year 1800 he
  offered himself, and was accepted by the Wesleyan Methodist Conference,
  as a missionary to British North America, where he laboured for several
  years. He removed thence to Bermuda. In 1814 he returned to England with
  a constitution greatly impaired, but continued to occupy regular stations
  under the direction of the Conference until 1836, when, worn out by
  affliction, he became a supernumerary, and resided in London, where he
  occasionally preached as his health permitted. He died August 11, 1837,
  aged sixty.</p>

  <p><i>Sidney as a Christian Name</i> (Vol. vii., p. 39.).&mdash;Your
  correspondent R. D. B., of Baltimore, is informed that the name of Sidney
  is extremely common in North Wales as a Christian name of either sex, but
  more particularly of the female.</p>

  <p>There seems to be no tradition connected with its use. In this part of
  the principality, the name <!-- Page 319 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page319"></a>{319}</span>has generally been assumed more from its
  euphonistic character than from any family connexion.</p>

  <p><i>The Whetstone</i> (Vol. vii., p. 208.).&mdash;In your No. 174. of
  "N. &amp; Q.," E. G. R. alludes to the <i>Game of the Whetstone</i>. The
  following quotation, as bearing on that subject, may not be uninteresting
  to your readers:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the fourth year of this king's (Edward VI.) reign, in the month of
  September, one Grig, a poulterer of Surrey (taken among the people for a
  prophet, in curing of divers diseases by words and prayers, and saying he
  would take no money), was, by command of the Earl of Warwick, and others
  of the Council, set on a scaffold in the town of Croidon, in Surrey, with
  a paper on his breast, wherein was written his deceitful and hypocritical
  dealings: and after that, on the eighth of September, set on a pillory in
  Southwark, being then Our Lady Fair there kept; and the Mayor of London,
  with his brethren the aldermen, riding through the fair, the said Grig
  asked them and all the citizens forgiveness.</p>

  <p>"'Of the like counterfeit physicians,' saith Stow, 'I have noted, in
  the summary of my <i>Chronicles</i> (anno 1382), to be set on horseback,
  his face to the horse-tail, the same tail in his hand as a bridle, a
  collar of jordans about his neck, a <i>whetstone</i> on his breast; and
  so led through the city of London, with ringing of basons, and
  banished.'</p>

  <p>"Whereunto I had added (with the forementioned author) as
  followeth:&mdash;Such deceivers, no doubt, are many who, being never
  trained up in reading or practice of physicke and chirurgery, do boast to
  doe great cures, especially upon women; as to make them straight that
  before were crooked, corbed, or cramped in any part of their bodies,
  &amp;c. But the contrary is true; for some have received gold, when they
  have better deserved the whetstone."&mdash;Goodall's <i>Royal College of
  Physicians</i>: London, 1684, p. 306.</p>

  <p><i>Surname of Allen</i> (Vol. vii., p. 205.).&mdash;Perhaps A. S. A.
  may find the following words in Celtic of use to him in his researches as
  to the origin of the name of Allan:&mdash;<i>Adlann</i>, pronounced
  <i>all&#x101;nn</i>, means a spearman or lancer; <i>aluin</i>, a white
  hind or fawn (Query, Do any of the name bear a hind as a crest?);
  <i>allin</i>, a rocky islet; <i>alain</i>, fair, bright, fair-haired,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Pot-guns</i> (Vol. vi., p. 612.; Vol. vii., p. 190.).&mdash;In the
  parish of Halvergate, a train of seventeen pot-guns is kept at the
  blacksmith's shop. <span class="sc">Mr. Woodward</span> is correct in
  stating that they are "short cylinders set perpendicularly in a frame,
  flat-candlestickwise;" but each pot-gun at Halvergate is set in a
  separate block of wood, and not several in a frame together. By touching
  the touchholes of each pot-gun successively with a bar of red-hot iron,
  and with the aid of two double-barrel guns, a royal salute is fired at
  every wedding or festive occasion in Halvergate.</p>

  <p><i>Graves Family</i> (Vol. vii., p. 130.).&mdash;Your correspondent
  <span class="sc">James Graves</span> will find a tolerable pedigree of
  the Graves family, commencing in the time of Edward IV., in the first
  volume of Dr. Nash's <i>Worcestershire</i>; and, in the notes thereto,
  many interesting particulars of various learned members of the family.
  Independent of the three portraits mentioned by your correspondent, of
  which I possess fine proof impressions, I have also one in mezzotinto of
  Morgan Graves, Esq., of Mickleton, county of Gloucester, and Lord of the
  Manor of Poden, in the co. of Worcester.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. B. Whitborne.</span></p>

  <p><i>Portrait Painters</i> (Vol. vii., p. 180.).&mdash;The name of the
  Derby artist was <i>Wright</i>, not <i>White</i>. I have seen several
  portraits by him of great excellence. The time of his death I do not
  recollect, but I think the greater part of his works were executed in the
  latter part of the last century. Have not some of them been exhibited in
  Pall Mall? I have not the means at hand of ascertaining the fact, but I
  think he painted the "Blacksmith's Forge," which was so admirably
  mezzotinted by Earlom.</p>

  <p><i>Plum Pudding</i> (Vol. vi., p. 604.).&mdash;Southey, in his
  <i>Omniana</i>, vol. i. p. 7., quotes the following receipt for English
  plum puddling, as given by the Chevalier d'Arvieux, who in 1658 made a
  voyage in an English forty-gun ship:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Leur pudding était détestable. C'est un composé de biscuit pilé, ou
  de farine, de lard, de raisins de Corinthe, de sel, et de poivre, dont on
  fait une pâte, qu'on enveloppe dans une serviette, et que l'on fait cuire
  dans le pot avec du bouillon de la viande; on la tire de la serviette, et
  on la met dans un plat, et on rappe dessus du vieux fromage, qui lui
  donne une odeur insupportable. Sans ce fromage la chose en elle-même
  n'est pas absolument mauvaise."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Cheese is now eaten with apple puddings and pies; but is there any
  nook in England where they still grate it over plum pudding? I have heard
  the joke of forgetting the pudding-cloth, told against Lord Macartney
  during his embassy in China. Your correspondent will find plum porridge
  and plum puddings mentioned together at page 122. vol. ii. of Knight's
  <i>Old England</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Muffs worn by Gentlemen</i> (Vol. vi., <i>passim</i>.).&mdash;The
  <i>Tatler</i>, No. 155., describing a meeting with his neighbour the
  upholsterer, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I saw he was reduced to extreme poverty by certain shabby
  superfluities in his dress; for notwithstanding that it was a very sultry
  day for the time of year, he wore a loose great coat and a <i>muff</i>,

  <p><i>The Burial Service by heart</i> (Vol. vii., p. 13.).&mdash;In the
  Life of the Rev. Griffith Jones, the celebrated founder of the Welsh
  circulating charity schools, is this note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Living amongst dissenters who disliked forms of prayer, he committed
  to memory the whole of the baptismal and burial services; and, as his
  delivery was very energetic, his friends frequently heard dissenters
  admire his addresses, which they praised as being extempore effusions
  unshackled by the Prayer Book!"</p>

  <p><i>Burrow</i> (Vol. vii., p. 205.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Balliolensis</span> says that in North Gloucestershire "the
  side of a thick coppice is spoken of as a very <i>burrow</i> place for
  cattle." He understands this to mean "sheltered, secure from wind;" and
  he asks to what etymology this sense can be attributed. I suspect the
  Anglo-Saxon <i>bearo</i>, a grove or copse, is the word here preserved.
  As a wood forms a fence against the wind, and is habitually so used and
  regarded by the agricultural population, the association of ideas is
  suitable enough in this interpretation. <i>Bearo</i>, first signifying
  the grove itself, might easily come to mark the shelter which the grove
  afforded. But there is also a compound of this word preserved in the
  ancient charters, in which the fitness of a place as a pasture for swine
  is the prominent notion. Kemble, <i>Cod. Dipl.</i>, No. 288.: "Hæc sunt
  pascua porcorum, quæ nostrâ linguâ Saxonicâ <i>denbera</i> nominamus." In
  the same sense the compound with the word <i>weald</i> (= a great forest)
  is found: weald-<i>bero</i>. The wood was considered by our forefathers
  as propitious to their swine, not only for its shelter, but also for the
  masts it supplied; and this may have further helped to associate
  <i>bearo</i> with the comforts of cattle.</p>

  <p>"<i>Coming home to men's business</i>" (Vol. vii., p.235.).&mdash;It
  is hardly requisite to state to the readers of "N. &amp; Q.," that many
  editions of Bacon's memorable, beautiful, and didactic <i>Essays</i>
  appeared in the distinguished author's lifetime, obviously having
  experienced (proved by prefatory epistles of different dates) the
  repeated revision and emendations of the writer. The <i>Essays</i> were
  clearly favourites with him, as well as with the then reading public.
  They were first published in 1597, preceded by a letter addressed "To M.
  Anthony Bacon, his deare Brother." The <i>ninth</i> edition was issued
  the year before his death, which took place April 9, 1626. In that
  edition is added a dedication "To the Right Honorable my very good Lo.
  the Duke of Buckingham, his Grace Lo. High Admirall of England;" signed,
  "<span class="sc">Fr. St. Alban</span>:" previous signatures being "Fran.
  Bacon" (1597); "Fr. Bacon" (1612); "Fra. Bacon" (no date). In this
  dedication to the Duke of Buckingham first appeared the passage inquired
  about: "I doe now (he tells the Duke) publish my <i>Essayes</i>; which,
  of all my other workes, haue beene most current: for that, as it seems,
  they <i>come home to Men's Businesse and Bosomes</i>."&mdash;How
  accurate, yet modest, an appreciation of his labours!</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">A Hermit at Hampstead.</span></p>

  <p>My copy of Lord Bacon's <i>Essays</i> is a 12mo.: London, 1668. And in
  the epistle dedicatory, the author himself tells the Duke of Buckingham
  as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I do now publish my <i>Essays</i>; which, of all my other works, have
  been most current: for that, as it seems, they <i>come home to men's
  business and bosomes</i>."</p>

  <p>This will carry J. P. eleven years further back, at all events.</p>

  <p><i>Heuristic</i> (Vol. vii., p. 237.), as an English scholar would
  write it, or <i>Hevristisch</i>, as it would be written by a German, is a
  word not to be found in the sixth edition of Kant's <i>Critik</i>
  (Leipzig, 1818), nor in his <i>Prolegomena</i> (Riga, 1783).<a
  name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Your
  correspondent's copy appears to have been tampered with. The title
  <i>Kritik</i> should be spelt with the initial <i>C</i>, and
  <i>reinen</i> should not have a capital letter: the Germans being very
  careful to prefix capitals to all substantives, but never to adjectives.
  The above-mentioned edition of the <i>Critik</i> was sent to me from
  Hamburg soon after its publication. It was printed by Fröbels at
  Rudolstadt in 1818; and is unblemished by a single <i>erratum</i>, so far
  as I have been able to detect one. Allow me to suggest to H. B. C. to
  collate the pages in his edition with the sixth of 1818; the seventh of
  1828; and, if possible, with one published in Kant's lifetime prior to
  1804; and he will probably find, that the very favourite word of Kant,
  <i>empirisch</i>, has been altered in a few instances to
  <i>hevristich</i>. <span class="sc">Mr. Haywood</span> is evidently
  inaccurate in writing <i>evristic</i>, which is wrong in Greek as well as
  in German and English.</p>

  <p>Instead of giving the pages of his copy, your correspondent will more
  oblige by stating the divisions under which this exceptional word occurs,
  in the running title at the top of each page of his copy; together with
  two or three lines of the context, which I can compare with my own copy.
  I <!-- Page 321 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page321"></a>{321}</span>have not here the facility of resort to a
  British Museum, or to German booksellers. Should your correspondent find
  any difficulty in effecting collation of his edition with others, I shall
  be willing to part with my copy <i>for a short time</i> for his use; or,
  if he will oblige me with his copy, I will collate it with mine, and
  return it within the week with the various readings of the cited
  passages.</p>

  <p><i>"Cob" and "Conners"</i> (Vol. vii., p. 234.).&mdash;These words are
  Celtic. <i>Cob</i> means a mouth, a harbour, an entrance. <i>Conners</i>
  appears to be a compound word, from <i>cuan</i>, a bay or harbour, and
  <i>mar</i> or <i>mara</i>, the sea; pronounced "Cuan wara," then
  shortened into <i>Conner</i>. Conna-mara, in the west of Ireland,
  properly spelled <i>Cuan na mara</i>, means "bays of the sea."</p>

  <p><i>Lady High Sheriff</i> (Vol. vii., p. 236.).&mdash;Your
  correspondent W. M. is informed that in Duncumb's <i>Herefordshire</i>
  there is no mention made of the fact, that a lady executed the office of
  high sheriff of the county. The high sheriffs for the years
  1768&mdash;1771 inclusive were Richard Gorges, William Nourse, Price
  Clutton, and Charles Hoskyns, Bart. The lady alluded to would be the
  widow of one of these.</p>

  <p class="author">H. C. K.</p>

  <p class="address">&mdash;&mdash; Rectory, Hereford.</p>

  <p>Anne Clifford, Countess of Dorset, Pembroke, and Montgomery, exercised
  the office of hereditary sheriff of Westmoreland, and, at the assizes at
  Appleby, sat with the judges on the bench (temp. Car. I.) Vide
  Blackstone's <i>Comment</i>., and Pocock's <i>Memorials of the Tufton
  Family</i>, p. 78. (1800.)</p>

  <p>I may add that ladies have also been included in the commission of the
  peace. The Lady Bartlet was made a justice of the peace by Queen Mary in
  Gloucestershire (Harl. MSS); Margaret, Countess of Richmond, mother of
  Henry VII., was made a justice of peace; and a lady in Sussex, of the
  name of Rowse, did usually sit on the bench at the assizes and sessions
  amongst other justices <i>cincta gladio</i> (<i>op. cit.</i>).</p>

  <p><i>Death of Nelson</i> (Vol. vii., p. 52.).&mdash;The "beautiful
  picture which hangs in a bad light in the hall of Greenwich Hospital" was
  not painted by West, but by Arthur William Devis, a very talented artist,
  but somewhat careless in financial matters. He was a pupil of Zoffeny,
  was in India for some years, where he practised portrait-painting with
  considerable success. The well-known print of the "Marquis Cornwallis
  receiving the Sons of Tippoo Saib as Hostages," was from a picture
  painted by him. The "Death of Nelson" at Greenwich was a commission from
  the house of Boydell, Cheapside; and a large print was afterwards
  published by them from it. Devis met the vessel on its return to England,
  and on its way homeward painted, very carefully, the portraits of the
  persons represented in his picture, and also a very exact view of the
  cockpit in which the hero died. The picture has great merit, and deserves
  to be better placed.</p>

  Keating, 1836. Every reader of Fox's <i>Book of Martyrs</i> should, in

  1588; but it is unfortunately very scarce.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Photographic Notes.</span> <i>In consequence of the

  for insertion, we have been compelled to postpone the</i> <span
  class="sc">Rev. Mr. Sisson</span><i>'s description of a new</i>
  Head-rest, <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Sir W. Newton</span><i>'s
  explanation of his</i> Process.</p>

  <p>A. S. K. (Worthing) <i>is informed that it is quite useless to extract
  the size from the paper of positive pictures, to ensure their permanence.
  If the hyposulphite of soda is entirely freed from them, they will bear
  any exposure to atmospheric influence without change. Although in all
  works on Photography it is recommended that the size should be extracted
  from negatives before waxing them, it is a process we have entirely
  dispensed with: if the iron is used sufficiently hot, the wax will
  perfectly permeate the entire texture of the paper. Our Correspondent is
  referred to our back Numbers for an account of the mode of taking a
  positive picture on glass from a glass negative.</i></p>

  <p>R. S. C. (Solihull) <i>shall receive a private communication on the
  subject of the construction of his glass house for Photographic purposes.
  There are points in it which are not generally attended to, and upon
  which the want of success of many operators has no doubt
  depended.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Tyro</span> (March 14th). <i>The second sample of
  collodion which you have used is</i> over-<i>iodized. It is quite
  requisite that it should be known that the sensitive properties of
  collodion are not increased by adding too much of the iodizing solution.
  If the collodion is good, the film is semi-transparent, of a bluish
  opal-like appearance. If the iodine is in excess, it becomes more opaque
  and creamy after immersion in the bath, and of a deep orange when looked
  through; whereas it should appear of a pale amber colour.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Tyro</span> (March 17th). <i>The reticulated
  appearance you complain of is from using your collodion too thick, and
  not giving the glass the rotatory rocking motion which you should do when
  you drain off the excess into the bottle. Prepare two pieces of glass
  with collodion: in one simply drain off the excess of collodion, and in
  the other use the motion which has been before described, and you will
  perceive the difference in the evenness of the two films.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">H. Henderson</span> (Glasgow). <i>We consider glass
  baths are much superior to gutta percha in every respect. Many of the
  unpleasant markings in collodion pictures may have their origin in the
  gutta percha. This is frequently adulterated, and the nitrate acts upon
  the extraneous substances which are added to the gutta percha, either for
  adulteration, to give it firmness, or an agreeable colour. A glass bath
  is readily made, but the minute details of the mode we cannot enter into.
  Our Correspondent is referred to our numerous advertising friends, as the
  readiest way to supply his present want in this respect. "Jefferies'
  Marine Glue" can be procured at all times, the cost being about sixpence
  per pound. One part of marine glue, and two of best red sealing-wax, form
  a beautiful cement for glass baths. The marine glue, when used alone,
  becomes detached from the glass by the nitrate solution; and, without a
  substance to temper it, the sealing-wax is too brittle.</i></p>

  <p>X. (Manchester). <i>When the blue spots occur of which our
  Correspondent complains, it is because there is at the time of operating
  very feeble actinic action in the light. If he were to rub one of these
  pictures when dry, he would find it almost entirely removable from the
  glass. The occasional want of brilliancy in all probability depends on
  the same cause. Proto-nitrate of iron, when prepared with the nitrate of
  baryta of commerce, instead of pure nitrate of baryta, will often have
  the same effect.</i></p>

  <p>A GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN GRECIAN, ROMAN, ITALIAN, AND GOTHIC
  ARCHITECTURE. The Fifth Edition enlarged, exemplified by 1700
  Woodcuts.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the Preparation of this the Fifth Edition of the Glossary of
  Architecture, no pains have been spared to render it worthy of the
  continued patronage which the work has received from its first
  publication.</p>

  <p>"The Text has been considerably augmented, as well by the additions of
  many new Articles, as by the enlargement of the old ones, and the number
  of Illustrations has been increased from eleven hundred to seventeen
  hundred.</p>

  <p>"Several additional Foreign examples are given, for the purpose of
  comparison with English work, of the same periods.</p>

  <p>"In the present Edition, considerably more attention has been given to
  the subject of Mediæval Carpentry, the number of Illustrations of 'Open
  Timber Roofs' has been much increased, and most of the Carpenter's terms
  in use at the period have been introduced with
  authorities."&mdash;<i>Preface to the Fifth Edition.</i></p>

  <p>THE CALENDAR OF THE ANGLICAN CHURCH; illustrated with Brief Accounts
  of the Saints who have Churches dedicated in their Names, or whose Images
  are most frequently met with in England; also the Early Christian and
  Mediæval Symbols, and an Index of Emblems.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is perhaps hardly necessary to observe, that this work is of an
  Archæological, and not a Theological character. The Editor has not
  considered it his business to examine into the truth or falsehood of the
  legends of which he narrates the substance; he gives them merely as
  legends, and, in general, so much of them only as is necessary to explain
  why particular emblems were used with a particular Saint, or why Churches
  in a given locality are named after this or that
  Saint."&mdash;<i>Preface.</i></p>

  <p>"The latter part of the book, on the early Christian and mediæval
  symbols, and on ecclesiastical emblems, is of great historical and
  architectural value. A copious Index of emblems is added, as well as a
  general Index to the volume with its numerous illustrations. The work is
  an important contribution to English Archæology, especially in the
  department of ecclesiastical iconography."&mdash;<i>Literary

  <p>* <span class="sc">Example.</span>&mdash;At the commencement of the
  year 1841, a person aged thirty took out a Policy for 1000<i>l.</i>, the
  annual payment for which is 24<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; in 1847 he
  had paid in premiums 168<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; but the profits
  being 2¼ per cent. per annum on the sum insured (which is 22<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> per annum for each 1000<i>l.</i>) he had 157<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> added to the Policy, almost as much as the premiums paid.</p>

  <p>The Premiums, nevertheless, are on the most moderate scale, and only
  one-half need be paid for the first five years, when the Insurance is for
  Life. Every information will be afforded on application to the Resident
